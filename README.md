# LRM

In LRM, a linear regression on martingale residuals is applied to carry out a recurrent event analysis in GWAS. LRM applies a saddle-point approximation to achieve statistical accuracy for low-frequency variants. 

The software can be downloaded in R by:
```
library(devtools)
install_github('JasperHof/LRM)
library(LRM)
```

Please do not hesitate to contact me (Jasper.Hof@radboudumc.nl) in case you have any questions or if you encounter a problem in your analysis :-).
